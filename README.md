### 15/09/16 - :p in bash

:p is not an emoticon. Type `!sa:p` and you'll see what the previous command you executed that starts with sa is. `:p`, that's colon with a lower case p, would show you the command then you can press the enter key if that's what you want to execute.

### 15/09/16 - su hyphen

The difference between `su user` and `su - user` ([ArchWiki](
https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Su)):

> The hyphen has two effects:
>
> 1) switches from the current directory to the home directory of the new user (e.g., to /root in the case of the root user) by logging in as that user
>
> 2) changes the environmental variables to those of the new user as dictated by their ~/.bashrc. That is, if the first argument to su is a hyphen, the current directory and environment will be changed to what would be expected if the new user had actually logged on to a new session (rather than just taking over an existing session).

In fact, avoid `su` if you can `sudo`.

### 14/09/16 - Local NTP server

If you need to keep the clocks of your network computers synchronised, you need to designate one computer as the reference (NTP server); the others are NTP clients. I'm assuming this network is not connected to the Internet, or to put it simply, is not connected to any authoritative low-stratum NTP server like `time.nist.gov`.

#### NTP server

Add the following in `/etc/ntp.conf`:
```
restrict 192.168.1.0 mask 255.255.255.0 nomodify notrap nopeer
...
server 127.127.1.0
fudge 127.127.1.0 stratum 10
```

modifying `192.168.1.0` and `255.255.255.0` to suit your network. The magic IP address is `127.127.1.0`; leave that alone.

Without the last two lines, any connecting clients will see that your server is stratum 16, i.e. lousy.

#### NTP client

Add the following in `/etc/ntp.conf`:
```
server XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX
```

where `XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX` is the IP address (or hostname) of your NTP server.

On the server and client, run `ntpq -p`, `ntpstat`, and `ntpdate -q XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX` for juicy NTP statistics.

### 10/9/16 Watson Developer Cloud and Emotion Analysis

TIL that [Watson Developer Cloud Tone Analyzer](http://www.ibm.com/watson/developercloud/tone-analyzer/api/v3/?python#post-tone) only classifies the tones `Anger, Disgust, Fear, Joy, Sadness`. As compared to the six [Universally Recognised Face Expressions of  Emotions](https://www.kairos.com/blog/the-universally-recognized-facial-expressions-of-emotion) -- Yes I know that Face Emotions and Tone Emotions are slightly different, but for the purposes of this argument, let's leave it first -- Watson does not have surprise. This is because *surprise* is an emotion that is usually very quick, then follower by *fear* or *joy*. 

In summary, TIL that after less than a second of shock, I will be feeling in awe (*joy*) or scared (*fear*). 

###  09/09/16 Writing multiple lines to a file in bash

Due to the need for creation of multiple scripts from one script in bash

```
cat >/home/ubuntu/Desktop/script.sh <<EOL
line 1, ${var1}
line 2, ${var2}

EOL
```

If you don't want the variables to be replaced, surround EOL with single quotes 
```
cat >/home/ubuntu/Desktop/script.sh <<'EOL'
line 1, ${var1}
line 2, ${var2}

EOL
```

### 30/08/16 Verifying RPM packages

Don't have the checksums for a `.rpm` file? Run `rpm -Kv X.rpm` on your favourite RPM-based Linux distro.

### 30/08/16 Transferring files without `scp`

Or you *do* have `scp`, but you're just really lazy to run `ssh-keygen` and stuff.

Go to the folder containing the file you want to share and run `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`. A HTTP server on port 8000 will be created.

Assuming the receiving machine is on the same network, `curl -O 192.168.X.Y:8000/file.extension` will do the job. Yes, you don't have `wget` too.

### 29/08/16 Computing checksums in PowerShell

`Get-FileHash [file] -Algorithm MD5` or `SHA256`

Extra tip: you can open `powershell` in `cmd`. But `bash` is still king!

### 28/08/16 Latency versus Bandwidth

Or "*I Regret Not Paying Attention in My Computer Networks Course*": [It's the Latency, Stupid](https://web.archive.org/web/20141204094820/http://www.stuartcheshire.org/rants/Latency.html)

> Years ago David Cheriton at Stanford taught me something that seemed very obvious at the time -- that if you have a network link with low bandwidth then it's an easy matter of putting several in parallel to make a combined link with higher bandwidth, but if you have a network link with bad latency then no amount of money can turn any number of them into a link with good latency.

### 25/08/16 - Patching Apollo 14

Or "*What I Don't Want to Ever Have to Do in My Life*".

#### [NASA](https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a14/a14AbortDiscrete.html)

> The intermittent short circuit of the ABORT button represented the most dramatic moment for the MIT computer folks in the entire Apollo program. They had between three and four hours to find a way for the computer to ignore it, test the fix at Grumman, then test it in Houston before sending it to the crew in time for PDI .

#### [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_14#Launch_and_flight_to_lunar_orbit)

> If the problem recurred after the descent engine fired, the computer would think the signal was real and would initiate an auto-abort, causing the ascent stage to separate from the descent stage and climb back into orbit.
>
> NASA and the software teams at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology scrambled to find a solution, and determined the fix would involve reprogramming the flight software to ignore the false signal. The software modifications were transmitted to the crew via voice communication, and Mitchell manually entered the changes (amounting to over 80 keystrokes on the LM computer pad) just in time.

### 25/08/16 - Building resilient systems

#### [Netflix Chaos Monkey](http://techblog.netflix.com/2015/09/chaos-engineering-upgraded.html)

> Several years ago we introduced a tool called Chaos Monkey. This service pseudo-randomly plucks a server from our production deployment on AWS and kills it. At the time we were met with incredulity and skepticism. Are we crazy? In production?!?

>  Building on the success of Chaos Monkey, we looked at an extreme case of infrastructure failure. We built Chaos Kong, which doesnâ€™t just kill a server. It kills an entire AWS Region.

#### [Space software](https://www.fastcompany.com/28121/they-write-right-stuff)

### 23/08/16 - Bash keyboard shortcuts

These are very useful when typing long commands.

`Ctrl-C` - cancels current input, and yes it also kills the current process

`Ctrl-L` - clears screen

`Ctrl-U` - deletes everything from cursor to start of line

`Ctrl-K` - deletes everything from cursor to end of line

`Ctrl-A` - moves cursor to start of line

`Ctrl-E` - moves cursor to end of line

`Ctrl-W` - deletes previous word

#### "But I will never use this!"

Arrow keys are for the weak, but I'm still weak for now because I don't use Vi mode in Bash. But I digress.

`Ctrl-C` is not a great command because it creates a new prompt (hence ugly). I use `Ctrl-E` (move cursor to end of line) and `Ctrl-U` to delete the current input. If I'm typing at the end of the line and I want to clear the input, I just use `Ctrl-U`.

`Ctrl-W` is useful if you mistyped an argument. I rarely use `Ctrl-K`, because such situations don't occur often.

`Ctrl-A` is useful if you want to append something to the front of some previous command, say.

"But I can use `!!`" I hear someone scream. Yes, `sudo !!` is very useful. However today I found myself stuck in a SQL shell with no support for `!!`. The stupid way to append `EXPLAIN` to a previous SQL query is to use the left arrow key and traverse back to the very beginning. A smarter way is to use `Ctrl-A` to jump there. The smartest way is still unknown, suspected to be in the mind of some wizened SQL guru in his sunlight-deprived room.

### 04/07/16 - Yum pointing to local repository mirror
Yum is a software management system for CentOS systems.
It is similar to aptitude for Ubuntu systems.

You can set up a yum local repository (I don''t know how),
but when you do any `yum install`, you can only install from the compatible versions.
For example, CentOS 6 can only install packages from a mirror that contains CentOS 6 packages
and not CentOS 7 packages.

* `$sudo vim /etc/yum.repos.d/CentOS-Base.repo`
* Comment out all `mirrorlist=http://mirrorlist.centos.org`...
and `baseurl=http://mirror.centos.org/`...
* Add instead your own url, i.e. `baseurl=http://192.168.201.203/repos/centos/6/8/`
* Just keep [base], the rest can delete

### 04/07/16 - Samba shared folder in Linux
1. Install samba: `$sudo yum install samba`
2. Set password for samba: `$sudo smbpasswd -a <USER_NAME>`
3. Create a directory to be shared: `mkdir /home/<USER_NAME>/<FOLDER_NAME>`
4. Edit samba config file:

```
$sudo vim /etc/samba/smb.conf

Add to the end of the file:
[<NAME_OF_SHARE>]
path = /home/<USER_NAME>/<FOLDER_NAME>
guest ok = yes
read only = no
```
Note that <NAME_OF_SHARE> should be less than 12 characters

An example would be:

```
[sharedInd]
path = /home/super/Desktop/sharedInd
guest ok = yes
```

5. Restart samba service: `$sudo smbd reload` for CentOS,
`$sudo service smbd restart` for Ubuntu
6. Test whether the `smb.conf` has any syntax errors: `testparm`
7. Opening the Linux samba share on Windows:
`//<IP_ADDRESS>/<FOLDER_NAME>`, i.e. `//192.168.201.108/sharedInd`
Note that the full path is not required; the folder will be automatically detected
8. Mounting the shared folder on another Linux version (02/07/16 - Mount a Windows Share in Linux)

### 04/07/16 - Kibana, Font Awesome, Bootstrap versions

### 11/07/16 - Download a node package to install offline
1. On Internet machine, `npm install --no-bin-link <PACKAGE_NAME>`
2. `npm pack` to get a tarball.
3. On non-internet machine, `npm install <tarball name>`
OR
2. Copy out the `node_modules` with `.zip/ .rar/ .tar`
3. Extract the bundle in offline environment

### 12/07/16 - Easily print Github markdown
https://gitprint.com

### 12/07/16 - Update a file in .jar file
`$zip -u stuff.jar file.txt`

### 12/07/16 - Update a jar file

Explode war file: `jar -xvf A.war`
Compact everything in this directory to a war file: `jar -cvf A.war .`

### 12/07/16 - Copy in Linux and force overwrite
`\cp <SOURCE> <DESTINATION>`

### 13/07/16 - A Gulp Application
(Glup.js)[http://gulpjs.com/] helps automate your web workflow to watch your files for changes and build them. More information can be found on the (Github Repo)[https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/blob/master/docs/getting-started.md]

```

### 13/07/16 - Jade template Engine
(Jade)[http://jade-lang.com/tutorial/] is an interesting HTML template engine. You don't have to add HTML tags but it is white space sensitive.

### 20/7/16 - To Add an entry into /etc/fstab
You need to use the following format:
```
string="echo $SHAREDFOLDER $SHAREDFOLDERLOCALMOUNT cifs username=$WINDOWSSHAREUSER,password=$WINDOWSSHAREPASSWORD,uid=super,gid=super  >> /etc/fstab"

sudo sh -c "$string"
```

Because if you just `sudo echo <STRING> >> /etc/fstab`,
you will get permission denied. This is because sudo elevates
your permission but >> uses reduced permissions again.

### 26/7/16 - UNIX tail -f vs tail -F
From man page 

WithÂ --followÂ (-f), tail defaults to following the file descriptor, which means that even if a tail'ed file is renamed, tail will continue to track its end. This default behavior is not desirable when you really want to track the actual name of the file, not the file descriptor (e.g., log rotation). UseÂ --follow=nameÂ in that case. That causes tail to track the named file in a way that accommodates renaming, removal and creation.

### 26/7/16 - Tail -f a log file from a server 
`ssh user@serverIP sudo tail -f <FILE_NAME>`

If ssh failed due to tty allocation: 
`ssh -t user@serverIP sudo tail -f <FILE_NAME>`

### 27/7/16 - Windows computer get Serial Number

- Install gVim for a better Windows Vim (reads `.vimrc` and `.gvimrc`)
- Install [Nuwen's MinGW Distro (without Git)](https://nuwen.net/mingw.html) for g++
- Add `PATH=$PATH:c/MinGW/bin` to `.bashrc` to use MinGW binaries in Git Bash (default MinGW shell is terrible)

### 8/8/16 - Mount windows share into /etc/fstab
- Windows share at C:\, i.e. <IP_ADDRESS>/<SHARED_FOLDER_NAME>
- Folder created in Linux machine at <LINUX_SHARE_FOLDER_PATH>
