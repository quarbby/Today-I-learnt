### 15/01/18 - Logstash ingestions 

Logstash has been very useful in ingesting data into Elastic Search, after which you can use Kibana to view and visualise the data. Really simple and cool. But here's a few stuff... 

Logstash is meant to ingest logs. So make sure your data file is formatted one entry per line. Which means there should be a new line between each entry. Which means, if you want to do that for a series of entries like json data, do the following: 
```
{.....entry 1.....}
{.....entry 2.....}
````

Shouldn't be too hard to write a few bash/python lines to format your data. Then turn on Elastic Search and Kibana (optional). Do make sure the ELK stack is in the same versioning because it's not really backward compatible :( 

Now you need to write a config file for ingesting the data. And our `conf/json_to_es.conf` goes like this: 
```
input {
	stdin {
	}
}

filter {
	json {
		source => "message"
		remove_field => [ "message", "host" ]
	}
}

output {
    elasticsearch {
		index => "twitter"
    }
}
```

Running the ingestion: `logstash -f ../conf/json_to_es.conf < data_file.json`. Oh do make sure you're in the logstash bin directory if you're using this command directly, otherwise do the necessary path changes. We're feeding the input from `stdin`, which we can read from the config file and the `<` operator. After the json is read, we do some filtering, basically putting the data into a source field called `message`, so that we don't mix up the data with the other meta-data. Then we remove some fields like original `message` field which is just a string of the json object that we fed in without formatting, and `host`, which describes the computer you ran the indexing on. Then we output the result to an index called `twitter`, which will autogenerate and create the fields that are the keys in the json object; saves us time from writing parsers.

### 08/01/18 - Bash Double Quotes

Quotations in bash can get tricky. Double quotes dereference variables, while single quotes go literal. 

```
A='123'  
echo "$A"   # Outputs 123
echo '$A'   # Outputs A
```

Also, I came across [this link](https://zwischenzugs.com/2018/01/06/ten-things-i-wish-id-known-about-bash/) while searching for that 

### 08/01/18 - Shell Startup 

I think [this picture](https://zwischenzugs.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/shell-startup-actual.png) is very informative to tell you where a shell goes when it starts up. I.e. which profile directories are entered.
