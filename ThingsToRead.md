### 07/10/16 - Google Interview University

[Get That job at Google](https://github.com/jwasham/google-interview-university)

> When I started this project, I didn't know a stack from a heap, didn't know Big-O anything, anything about trees, or how to traverse a graph. If I had to code a sorting algorithm, I can tell ya it wouldn't have been very good. Every data structure I've ever used was built into the language, and I didn't know how they worked under the hood at all. I've never had to manage memory, unless a process I was running would give an "out of memory" error, and then I'd have to find a workaround. I've used a few multi-dimensional arrays in my life and thousands of associative arrays, but I've never created data structures from scratch.

But after going through this study plan I have high confidence I'll be hired. It's a long plan. It's going to take me months. If you are familiar with a lot of this already it will take you a lot less time.

### 27/09/16 - Monkey Lives

[Monkey Lives](http://www.folklore.org/StoryView.py?project=Macintosh&story=Monkey_Lives.txt)

> The Monkey was a small desk accessory that used the journaling hooks to feed random events to the current application, so the Macintosh seemed to be operated by an incredibly fast, somewhat angry monkey, banging away at the mouse and keyboard, generating clicks and drags at random positions with wild abandon. It had great potential as a testing tool, so Capps refined it to generate more semantically rich events, with a certain percentage of the events as menu commands, a certain percentage as window drags, etc.

> We thought it would be a good test for an application to see if it could run the Monkey all night, but usually it didn't run for more than 20 minutes, even if it didn't crash, because the Monkey would invariably select the quit command.

[What Designers can learn from Product Managers](https://medium.com/the-year-of-the-looking-glass/what-designers-can-learn-from-pms-3aa285f511bc#.iyvc65vmt). In essence, our Programme Managers/ Development Managers are something like Product Managers: they figure a way to get the product delivered and sold. Sometimes we need to learn to talk to them.
