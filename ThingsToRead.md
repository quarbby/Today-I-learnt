### 04/02/17 - 8 Signs an Employee Should Be Fired (Which Never Appear on Performance Evaluations)

[8 Signs an Employee Should Be Fired] (http://www.inc.com/jeff-haden/8-signs-an-employee-should-be-fired-that-never-appear-on-performance-evaluations.html)

> Before a meeting, some of us were talking about supervisors in another department when our new boss looked up and said, "Stop. From now on we will never say anything bad about anyone unless they are actually in the room. Period."
>
> Not only do employees who create a culture of gossip waste time better spent on productive conversations, but they also cause other people to respect their co-workers a little less -- and anything that diminishes the dignity or respect of any employee should never be tolerated.

Guilty of some of these too. I am trying not to gossip anymore.

### 04/02/17 - Blameless Postmortems

[Etsy’s Debriefing Facilitation Guide for Blameless Postmortems](https://codeascraft.com/2016/11/17/debriefing-facilitation-guide/)

> All too often, when teams get together to discuss an event, they walk into the room with a story they've already rationalized about what happened. This urge to point to a "root" cause is seductive — it allows us to believe that we've understood the event well enough, and can move on towards fixing things.

A blame culture is toxic, and I'm partially guilty of that. This is made worse by the occasional desire to appear smart ("I am always right"), another toxic trait.

[If Your Team Agrees on Everything, Working Together Is Pointless](https://hbr.org/2017/01/if-your-team-agrees-on-everything-working-together-is-pointless)

> If you think beyond the trite clichés, it’s obvious: Collaborating is unnecessary if you agree on everything. Building on one another's ideas only gets you incremental thinking. If you avoid disagreeing, you leave faulty assumptions unexposed. As Walter Lippmann said, "Where all think alike, no one thinks very much." To maximize the benefit of collaborating, you need to diverge before you converge.

Recommended by my big boss. Worth a read.

### 04/02/17 - Lessons from 7 highly successful software engineering cultures

[Lessons from 7 highly successful software engineering cultures](https://techbeacon.com/lessons-7-highly-successful-software-engineering-cultures)

> - Cut the red tape. Don’t impose processes for every little thing.
> - Hire responsible people. The best people require less process and overhead, and people with good ethical judgment and time management skills require fewer policies for guidance.
> - Reduce complexity. Smaller teams and simpler solutions are more adaptable and maintainable. Shorter, smaller projects keep teams from getting bogged down and losing momentum.
> - Exercise kindness, good communication, and humility. Along with data-driven debates, these qualities help companies remove barriers to productive collaboration.
> - Allow mistakes. Place greater emphasis on learning from mistakes and focus less on repercussions. Doing so creates a more innovative, experimental, and versatile organization that can adapt quickly to changing markets.

I believe these have to be tackled first, followed by some serious upgrading in technical skills, before anyone can talk about "innovation" or the "fourth industrial revolution".

### 02/01/17 - How to ask good questions

[How to ask good questions](https://jvns.ca/blog/good-questions/)

> To start out – I'm actually kind of a big believer in asking dumb questions or questions that aren't "good". I ask people kind of dumb questions all the time, questions that I could have answered with Google or by searching our codebase. I mostly try not to, but sometimes I do it anyway and I don't think it's the end of the world.

Similar to my approach of asking questions:

- confirming all assumptions, no matter how obvious/stupid they are ("is this a database?")
- asking yes/no questions
- "reading back" to ensure both sides have a common understanding
- doing prior research to show that you did some homework

Not forgetting the pleasantries before and after.

To digress on how to be good *answerer*:

I have a bad habit of sometimes jumping to conclusions ("The problem is definitely...") without complete evidence, only to realise the mistake later ("...oops"). The best thing to do is to admit the mistake.

I've since learnt to be *really sure* with *compelling evidence* ("I did this and this and printed out all these...").

There's also nothing wrong with saying "I don't know, but I can Google it for you, and we'll both learn something new at the end of the day".

[Unix Recovery Legend](http://www.ee.ryerson.ca/~elf/hack/recovery.html)

>  When I arrived at his office, his door was ajar, and within ten seconds I realised what the problem was. James, our manager, was sat down, head in hands, hands between knees, as one whose world has just come to an end. Our newly-appointed system programmer, Neil, was beside him, gazing listlessly at the screen of his terminal. And at the top of the screen I spied the following lines:
>
> \# cd
>
> \# rm -rf * 
>
> ...
>
> Now, you're asking yourself (as I am), what's the moral of this story? Well, for one thing, you must always remember the immortal words, DON'T PANIC. Our initial reaction was to reboot the machine and try everything as single user, but it's unlikely it would have come up without /etc/init and /bin/sh. Rational thought saved us from this one.

> Goto. I use that (in C) for error handling all the time, and frankly, it is about the cleanest way to do it I have seen.

Some trivia: Java does not have goto, which annoyed me because I *needed* it for my state machine.

### 31/10/16 - Big Data Frameworks Compared
[A tutorial by Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/hadoop-storm-samza-spark-and-flink-big-data-frameworks-compared) 

> Big data is a blanket term for the non-traditional strategies and technologies needed to gather, organize, process, and gather insights from large datasets. While the problem of working with data that exceeds the computing power or storage of a single computer is not new, the pervasiveness, scale, and value of this type of computing has greatly expanded in recent years.

> Batch-only frameworks: Apache Hadoop

> Stream-only frameworks: Apache Storm, Apache Samza

> Hybrid frameworks: Apache Spark, Apache Flink

### 07/10/16 - Google Interview University

[Get That job at Google](https://github.com/jwasham/google-interview-university)

> When I started this project, I didn't know a stack from a heap, didn't know Big-O anything, anything about trees, or how to traverse a graph. If I had to code a sorting algorithm, I can tell ya it wouldn't have been very good. Every data structure I've ever used was built into the language, and I didn't know how they worked under the hood at all. I've never had to manage memory, unless a process I was running would give an "out of memory" error, and then I'd have to find a workaround. I've used a few multi-dimensional arrays in my life and thousands of associative arrays, but I've never created data structures from scratch.

But after going through this study plan I have high confidence I'll be hired. It's a long plan. It's going to take me months. If you are familiar with a lot of this already it will take you a lot less time.

### 27/09/16 - Monkey Lives

[Monkey Lives](http://www.folklore.org/StoryView.py?project=Macintosh&story=Monkey_Lives.txt)

> The Monkey was a small desk accessory that used the journaling hooks to feed random events to the current application, so the Macintosh seemed to be operated by an incredibly fast, somewhat angry monkey, banging away at the mouse and keyboard, generating clicks and drags at random positions with wild abandon. It had great potential as a testing tool, so Capps refined it to generate more semantically rich events, with a certain percentage of the events as menu commands, a certain percentage as window drags, etc.
>
> ...

> We thought it would be a good test for an application to see if it could run the Monkey all night, but usually it didn't run for more than 20 minutes, even if it didn't crash, because the Monkey would invariably select the quit command.
